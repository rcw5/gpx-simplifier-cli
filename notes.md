* It's pretty simple, really: for each triplet of vertices A-B-C, we compute
 * how much cross-track error we'd introduce by going straight from A to C
 * (the maximum cross-track error for that segment is the height of the
 * triangle ABC, measured between vertex B and edge AC.)  If we need to remove
 * 40 points, we just sort the points by that metric and remove the 40
 * smallest ones.
 *
 * It's actually a little more complicated than that, because removing a
 * point changes the result for its two nearest neighbors.  When we remove
 * one, we recompute the neighbors and then sort them back into the list
 * at their new locations.


 I.e for points A, B, C, D, E
 
 Calculate distance between AB and BC and sum
 Calculate distance between AC directly
 This is the XTE

 Repeat for BCD, CDE

 Sort the XTEs
 remove the smallest one.
 Recompute the neighbours
 Sort back into list.
